	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that helps us understand and analyze how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of its input. It provides efficient an algorithm in terms of the amount of computational time it takes to complete as the input size grows.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It helps us understand how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory, which is crucial for evaluating and optimizing performance, especially for large datasets or in environments with limited resources.
	Linear Time:O(n) The running time grows linearly with the input size. </p>
